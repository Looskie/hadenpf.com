If you're like me and you were born in the early 2000s, you'll have spent a large chunk (though I'm hesitant to call it a "majority")
of your time online, or at least using digital technology. Now — bear with me for a moment — ask yourself this:

> What did people do with their time when being online *wasn't* a thing you could just *do?*

I don't mean to sound like the stereotypical judgmental old-person character who says things like
*"no click book. only turn page."* here — but really think about it. If you're past your early 20s, you can probably draw
an answer to this quite a bit easier than a younger person will be able to.
