banter: "'Object Permanence' is a metaphor for having a long-term place to store ideas and thoughts. I know it's a silly title. I just don't care."

I've been aching for a place to write longer-form posts! I've had some content ideas for the longest time and just never had a good place to write it out. I haven't written much of anything _good_ for a few years, so I've kinda lost my touch.

I'll probably spend the next few weeks writing up some [projects] to showcase, and then return to write some [words] when I have some â€” in fact, I'll probably do both of those things fairly asynchronously.

I'm happy to finally have a nice place to write stuff. Some self-engineered object permanence.

[projects]: /projects
[words]: /words
