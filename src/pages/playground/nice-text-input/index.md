I created a text input inspired originally by the [Apple Store]'s text inputs
that appear during the checkout process.

This particular text-input design felt super nice to use and I had an
itch to recreate it. I didn't actually find an excuse to make this until I
started working on [Fundrr], but it finally doing it was super rewarding!
