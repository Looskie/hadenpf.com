		Hey, welcome to my new site! I'm currently writing it from the ground up using [Astro].
		
		I’m a Kansas City-based, UX-focused, accessibility-dedicated, code-quality-focused software engineer (in that order) with a specialty in frontend code using React and TypeScript.
		
		You can expect some more exciting things on this site fairly soon — I'm currently putting together all the pieces needed to show dynamic content, all in my spare time —
		so it doesn't get all my love and attention right now.
